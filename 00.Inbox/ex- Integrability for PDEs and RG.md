> [!exercise] Exercise 3.4.20 (**Integrability for PDEs**):
> For given functions $P_k^i(x,u)$, where $x=(x^1,\ldots,x^n)$, $u=(u^1,\ldots,u^m)$, $i=1,\ldots,m$, and $k=1,\ldots,n$, consider the initial value problems for a system of first-order PDEs
> $$\begin{aligned}
> \frac{\partial u^i}{\partial x^k}&=P_k^i(x,u(x)),\\
> u(x_0)&=u_0.
> \end{aligned}$$
>   1. Show that
> $$\frac{\partial^2u^i}{\partial x^k\partial x^l}=\frac{\partial P_l^i}{\partial x^k}+\frac{\partial P_l^i}{\partial u^j}P_k^j,$$
> and conclude that all such initial value problems can only be solved when the **integrability conditions**
> $$\frac{\partial P_l^i}{\partial x^k}+\frac{\partial P_l^i}{\partial u^j}P_k^j=\frac{\partial P_k^i}{\partial x^l}+\frac{\partial P_k^i}{\partial u^j}P_l^j$$
> hold.
> 2. Conversely show that all such initial value problems can be solved if the integrability conditions hold. Hint: This is equivalent to the Frobenius integrability theorem but can be established directly (see also [97, vol. 1]). When $P$ does not depend on $u$, this result goes back to Clairaut. The general case appears to have been a folklore result that predates what we call the Frobenius theorem about integrability of distributions.
> 3. Using coordinates $x^i$ on a Riemannian $n$-manifold form the system
> $$\frac{\partial U_j^i}{\partial x^k}=\Gamma_{kj}^sU_s^i,\quad i,j=1,\ldots,n$$
> and show that its integrability conditions are equivalent to $R^s_{klj}=0$.
> 4. Show that a flat Riemannian manifold admits Cartesian coordinates. Hint: Denote the potential Cartesian coordinates by $u^i$ and consider the system:
> $$\frac{\partial u^i}{\partial x^k}=U_k^i$$
> with appropriate initial values. Make sure you check that $u^i$ really form a Cartesian coordinate system. This way of locally characterizing Euclidean space is very close in spirit to Riemann's original approach. Hint: Consider the derivative of
> $$g^{kl}\frac{\partial u^i}{\partial x^k}\frac{\partial u^j}{\partial x^l},$$
> where $g_{kl}$ denotes the metric with respect to $x$ and use 2.5.8.
