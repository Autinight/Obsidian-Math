## Collar Neighborhood

> [!definition] Definition: 
> Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with boundary. A neighborhood of $\partial M$ is called a **collar neighborhood** if it is the image of a smooth embedding $[0,1)\times\partial M\to M$ that restricts to the obvious identification $\{0\}\times\partial M\to\partial M$. (See Fig. 9.9.)

## Collar Neighborhood Theorem

> [!theorem] Collar Neighborhood Theorem: 
> If $M$ is a smooth manifold with nonempty boundary, then $\partial M$ has a collar neighborhood.
