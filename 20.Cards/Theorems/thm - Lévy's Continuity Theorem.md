## Statement

> [!theorem] Theorem: 
> Let $X_{n}$ be a sequence of random variables, $X$ be a random variable. $F_{n}$ and $F$ are their distribution functions, $\varphi _{n}\left(t\right)$ and $\varphi \left(t\right)$ are their characteristic functions.
> Then, $F_{n}$  [[Weak Convergence|converges weakly]] to $F$, iff $\varphi_{n}$ converges pointwiesly to $\varphi$.
