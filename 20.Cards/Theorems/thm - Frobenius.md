> [!theorem] Theorem: Frobenius
> Every involutive distribution is completely integrable.

> [!note] Note: 
> * The crital of the theorem is that we use the involution(closed under Lie bracket) to find the commution(zero under Lie barcket). Then we use the [[thm - Canonical Form for Commuting Vector Fields]] to gives flat chart.
> * Then Step 2, we use the local nice integrability to get a real integral manifold, that is the second abnormal part of the theorem.
