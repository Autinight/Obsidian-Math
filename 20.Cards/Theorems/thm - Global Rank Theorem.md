> [!theorem] Theorem: Global Rank Theorem
> Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds, and suppose $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map of constant rank.
> 1. If $F$ is surjective, then it is a smooth submersion.
> 2. If $F$ is injective, then it is a smooth immersion.
> 3. If $F$ is bijective, then it is a diffeomorphism.
