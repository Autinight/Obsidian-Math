> [!proposition] Local Structure of Integral Manifolds
> Let $D$ be an involutive distribution of rank $k$ on a smooth manifold $M$, and let $(U,(x^i))$ be a flat chart for $D$. If $H$ is any integral manifold of $D$, then $H\cap U$ is a union of countably many disjoint open subsets of parallel $k$-dimensional slices of $U$, each of which is open in $H$ and embedded in $M$.
