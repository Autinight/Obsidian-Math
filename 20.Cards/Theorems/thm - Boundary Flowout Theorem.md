> [!theorem] Boundary Flowout Theorem
> Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with nonempty boundary, and let $N$ be a smooth vector field on $M$ that is inward-pointing at each point of $\partial M$. There exist a smooth function $\delta: \partial M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ and a smooth embedding $\Phi: \mathscr{P}_\delta \rightarrow M$, where $\mathscr{P}_\delta = \{(t, p) : p \in \partial M, 0 \leq t < \delta(p)\} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \times \partial M$, such that $\Phi(\mathscr{P}_\delta)$ is a neighborhood of $\partial M$, and for each $p \in \partial M$ the map $t \mapsto \Phi(t, p)$ is an integral curve of $N$ starting at $p$.
