> [!theorem] Theorem: Flowout Theorem
> Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold, $S \subseteq M$ is an embedded $k$-dimensional submanifold, and $V \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ is a smooth vector field that is nowhere tangent to $S$. Let $\theta: \mathscr{D} \to M$ be the flow of $V$, let $\mathscr{O} = (\mathbb{R} \times S) \cap \mathscr{D}$, and let $\Phi = \theta|_{\mathscr{O}}$.
> 1. $\Phi: \mathscr{O} \to M$ is an immersion.
> 2. $\partial/\partial t \in \mathfrak{X}(\mathscr{O})$ is $\Phi$-related to $V$.
> 3. There exists a smooth positive function $\delta: S \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the restriction of $\Phi$ to $\mathscr{O}_\delta$ is injective, where $\mathscr{O}_\delta \subseteq \mathscr{O}$ is the flow domain
>       $$\mathscr{O}_\delta = \{(t, p) \in \mathscr{O} : |t| < \delta(p)\}.$$
>       Thus, $\Phi(\mathscr{O}_\delta)$ is an immersed submanifold of $M$ containing $S$, and $V$ is tangent to this submanifold.
> 4. If $S$ has codimension $1$, then $\Phi|_{\mathscr{O}_\delta}$ is a diffeomorphism onto an open submanifold of $M$.
