> [!theorem] Theorem: Canonical Form Near a Regular Point
> Let $V$ be a smooth vector field on a smooth manifold $M$, and let $p\in M$ be a regular point of $V$. There exist smooth coordinates $(s^i)$ on some neighborhood of $p$ in which $V$ has the coordinate representation $\partial/\partial s^1$. If $S\subseteq M$ is any embedded hypersurface with $p\in S$ and $V_p\notin T_pS$, then the coordinates can also be chosen so that $s^1$ is a local defining function for $S$.
