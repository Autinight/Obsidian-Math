> [!theorem] Fundamental Theorem on Flows
> Let $V$ be a smooth vector field on a smooth manifold $M$. There is a unique smooth maximal flow $\theta:\mathscr{D}\to M$ whose infinitesimal generator is $V$. This flow has the following properties:
> 1. For each $p\in M$, the curve $\theta^{(p)}:\mathscr{D}^{(p)}\to M$ is the unique maximal integral curve of $V$ starting at $p$.
> 2. If $s\in\mathscr{D}^{(p)}$, then $\mathscr{D}^{(\theta(s,p))}$ is the interval $\mathscr{D}^{(p)}-s=\{t-s:t\in\mathscr{D}^{(p)}\}$.
> 3. For each $t\in\mathbb{R}$, the set $M_t$ is open in $M$, and $\theta_t:M_t\to M_{-t}$ is a diffeomorphism with inverse $\theta_{-t}$.
