> [!corollary] Corollary: 
> Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold, $D$ is an involutive rank-$k$ distribution on $M$, and $S \subseteq M$ is a codimension-$k$ embedded submanifold. If $p \in S$ is a point such that $T_pS$ is complementary to $D_p$, then there is a flat chart $(U, (s^i))$ for $D$ centered at $p$ in which $S \cap U$ is the slice $s^1 = \cdots = s^k = 0$.
