> [!proposition] Proposition: The Pullback Orientation
> Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary. If $F:M\to N$ is a local diffeomorphism and $N$ is oriented, then $M$ has a unique orientation, called the **pullback orientation induced by $F$**, such that $F$ is orientation-preserving.
