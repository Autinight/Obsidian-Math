> [!proposition] Proposition: 
>  Let $R$ be a root system with a base $B$. Take any $\gamma\in R$. Show that the set $\{s_{\gamma}(\alpha):\alpha\in B\}$ is also a base of $R$.

> [!proof] Proof: 
> $s_{\gamma }$ is an invertible linear transformation keeping the inner product([[Base for a Root System]]). , thus $\left\{ s_{\gamma }\left(\alpha \right) \right\}$ is a base for $s_{\gamma }\left(R\right)= R$.
