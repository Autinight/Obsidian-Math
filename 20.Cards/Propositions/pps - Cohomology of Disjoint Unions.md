> [!proposition] Cohomology of Disjoint Unions
> Let $\{M_j\}$ be a countable collection of smooth $n$-manifolds with or without boundary, and let $M=\bigsqcup_j M_j$. For each $p$, the inclusion maps $\iota_j\colon M_j\hookrightarrow M$ induce an isomorphism from $H_{\mathrm{dR}}^p(M)$ to the direct product space $\prod_j H_{\mathrm{dR}}^p(M_j)$.
