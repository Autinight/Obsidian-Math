> [!proposition] Proposition: The Orientation Determined by a Coordinate Atlas.
> Let $M$ be a smooth positive-dimensional manifold with or without boundary. Given any consistently oriented smooth atlas for $M$, there is a unique orientation for $M$ with the property that each chart in the given atlas is positively oriented. Conversely, if $M$ is oriented and either $\partial M=\varnothing$ or $\dim M>1$, then the collection of all oriented smooth charts is a consistently oriented atlas for $M$.
