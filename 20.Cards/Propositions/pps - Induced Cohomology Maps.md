> [!proposition] Proposition (Induced Cohomology Maps)
> For any smooth map $F: M \to N$ between smooth manifolds with or without boundary, the pullback $F^*: \Omega^p(N) \to \Omega^p(M)$ carries $\mathcal{Z}^p(N)$ into $\mathcal{Z}^p(M)$ and $\mathcal{B}^p(N)$ into $\mathcal{B}^p(M)$. It thus descends to a linear map, still denoted by $F^*$, from $H^p_{\mathrm{dR}}(N)$ to $H^p_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)$, called the **induced cohomology map**. It has the following properties:
> (a) If $G: N \to P$ is another smooth map, then
> $$\begin{aligned} (G \circ F)^* = F^* \circ G^* : H^p_{\mathrm{dR}}(P) \to H^p_{\mathrm{dR}}(M). \end{aligned}$$
> (b) If $\operatorname{Id}$ denotes the identity map of $M$, then $\operatorname{Id}^*$ is the identity map of $H^p_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)$.
