  - Global Flow as family of Integral Curves for Infinitesimal Generator
---

> [!proposition] Proposition:
> Let $\theta:\mathbb{R}\times M\to M$ be a smooth global flow on a smooth manifold $M$. The infinitesimal generator $V$ of $\theta$ is a smooth vector field on $M$, and each curve $\theta^{(p)}$ is an integral curve of $V$.
