> [!lemma] Lemma: **Poincaré Lemma with Compact Support**
> Let $n\ge p\ge 1$, and suppose $\omega$ is a compactly supported closed $p$-form on $\mathbb{R}^n$. If $p=n$, suppose in addition that $\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\omega=0$. Then there exists a compactly supported smooth $(p-1)$-form $\eta$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $d\eta=\omega$.
