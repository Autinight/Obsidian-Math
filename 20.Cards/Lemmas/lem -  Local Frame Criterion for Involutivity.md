> [!lemma] Lemma: Local Frame Criterion for Involutivity
> Let $D \subseteq TM$ be a distribution. If in a neighborhood of every point of $M$ there exists a smooth local frame $(V_1, \ldots, V_k)$ for $D$ such that $[V_i, V_j]$ is a section of $D$ for each $i, j = 1, \ldots, k$, then $D$ is involutive.
