> [!lemma] Lemma: 
> Let $R$ be a root system in the real vector space $E$. We may write $R$ as a disjoint union
> $$R=R_1\cup R_2\cup\dots\cup R_k,$$
> where each $R_i$ is an irreducible root system in the space $E_i$ spanned by $R_i$, and $E$ is a direct sum of the orthogonal subspaces $E_1,\dots,E_k$.
