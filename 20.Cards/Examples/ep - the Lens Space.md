> Let $p,q$ be coprime numbers. Let $\zeta$ be a primitive $p^{\mathrm{th}}$ root of unity and treat it as the generator of the group $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Represent $\mathbb{S}^3$ as a closed subspace of unit vectors in $\mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{C}$. Define an action of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ on $\mathbb{S}^3$ by the formula $\zeta\mapsto\phi_q$, where the diffeomorphism $\phi_q:\mathbb{S}^3\to\mathbb{S}^3$ is given by
> $$\begin{aligned} \phi_q : (z_0, z_1) \mapsto (\zeta z_0, \zeta^q z_1). \end{aligned}$$
> Since $q$ is coprime to $p$, $\phi_q$ is a diffeomorphism of order $p$. Notice that the orbit of any point is independent of the choice of the primitive root that we have chosen. The quotient space is denoted by $L(p,q)$ and is called a *lens space*. Verify that the action is fixed point free and hence even. Note that $L(p,q)$ is a closed connected 3-manifold. Obviously, its fundamental group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
