> [!definition] Definition: 
> Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold, and let $\mathcal{F}$ be any collection of $k$-dimensional submanifolds of $M$. 
> * A smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ for $M$ is said to be **flat for $\mathcal{F}$** if $\varphi(U)$ is a cube in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and each submanifold in $\mathcal{F}$ intersects $U$ in either the empty set or a countable union of $k$-dimensional slices of the form $x^{k+1}=c^{k+1},\dots,x^n=c^n$. 
> * We define a **foliation of dimension $k$ on $M$** to be a collection $\mathcal{F}$ of disjoint, connected, nonempty, immersed $k$-dimensional submanifolds of $M$ (called the **leaves of the foliation**), whose union is $M$, and such that in a neighborhood of each point $p\in M$ there exists a flat chart for $\mathcal{F}$.
