## Statement

> [!definition] Definition: Covering Space
> Let $p:\overline{X}\to X$ be a surjective map.
>
> - We say an open subset  $V$ of $X$ is **evenly coverd** by p, if $p ^{-1} \left( V \right)$ is a disjoint union of open subsets of $\overline{X}$:
>
> $
> p ^{-1} \left( V \right)= \coprod _{i}U_{i}
> $
>
> where, each $U_{i}$ is maped homeomorphically onto $V$ by p.
>
> - In this case, we shall refer to each $U_{i}$ as a **sheet**  for $p$ over V.
>
> - If the space $X$ can be covered by open subsets which are evenly covered by $p$, then we say that $p$ is a **covering projection**; the space $\overline{X}$ is called a covering space of $X$.
