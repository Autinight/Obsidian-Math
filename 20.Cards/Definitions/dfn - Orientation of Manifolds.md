## Definition

> [!definition] Definition: 
> Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary.
> * We define a **pointwise orientation** on $M$ to be a choice of orientation of each tangent space.
> * When $M$ is endowed with a pointwise orientation. If $\left(E_{i}\right)$ is a local frame for $TM$, we say that $\left(E_{i}\right)$ is **(positively) oriented** if $\left(\left. E_1 \right|_{p},\cdots ,\left. E_{n} \right|_{p}\right)$ is a positevely oriented basis for $T_{p}M$ at each point $p\in U$. A **negatively oriented** frame is defined analogously.
> * A pointwise orientation is said to be **continuous** if every point of $M$ is in the domain of an oriented local frame.
> * An **orientation of $M$** is a continuous pointwise orientation.
> * We say that $M$ is **orientable** if there exists an orientation for it, and **nonorientable** if not.
> * An **oriented manifold(with boundary)** is an ordered pair $\left(M, \mathcal{O}\right)$, where $M$ is an orientable smooth manifold(with boundary) and $\mathcal{O}$ is a choice of orientation for $M$.
