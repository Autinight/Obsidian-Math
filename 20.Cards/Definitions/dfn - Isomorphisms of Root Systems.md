> [!definition] Definition
> Let $R$ and $R'$ be root systems in the real inner-product spaces $E$ and $E'$, respectively. We say that $R$ and $R'$ are isomorphic if there is a vector space isomorphism $\varphi:E\to E'$ such that
> * (a) $\varphi(R)=R'$, and
> * (b) for any two roots $\alpha,\beta\in R$, $\langle\alpha,\beta\rangle=\langle\varphi(\alpha),\varphi(\beta)\rangle$.
