> [!definition] Definition: 
> Let $R^+$ denote the set of all positive roots in a root system $R$ with respect to a base $B$, and let $R^-$ be the set of all negative roots. Then $R=R^+\cup R^-$, a disjoint union. The set $B$ is contained in $R^+$;
> * The elements of $B$ are called **simple roots**. 
> * We may also denote $B$ by $\Delta$ and call it a **simple root system**.
> * The reflections $s_\alpha$ for $\alpha\in B$ are known as **simple reflections**.
