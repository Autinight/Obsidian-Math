> [!definition] Definition: 
>* We say the action is **even** (classically, **properly discontinuous**) if given any $x\in X$ there exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ in $X$, such that $gU\cap U=\emptyset$ for all $g\neq e$.  
>* We shall call such a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ an **even neighbourhood**. 

> [!remark] Remark: 
> * Here $gU$ denotes the set $\{gx:x\in U\}$
> * It is easy to see that an even action is fixed point free.
