## Ordered Bases that are Consistently Oriented 

> [!definition] Definition
> Thus we are led to introduce the following definition. Let $V$ be a real vector space of dimension $n \geq 1$. We say that two ordered bases $(E_1, \dots, E_n)$ and $(\tilde{E}_1, \dots, \tilde{E}_n)$ for $V$ are **consistently oriented** if the transition matrix $(B_i^j)$, defined by

> [!lemma] Lemma: 
> Being cosistently oriented is an equivalence relation on the set of all ordered bases for $V$, and there are exactly two equivalence classes.

## Orientation of Vector Space 

> [!definition] Definition: 
> * If $\dim V = n \ge 1$, we define an **orientation for $V$** as an equivalence class of ordered bases. 
> * If $(E_1, \dots, E_n)$ is any ordered basis for $V$, we denote the orientation that it determines by $[E_1, \dots, E_n]$, and the opposite orientation by $-[E_1, \dots, E_n]$. 
> * A vector space together with a choice of orientation is called an **oriented vector space**. If $V$ is oriented, then any ordered basis $(E_1, \dots, E_n)$ that is in the given orientation is said to be **oriented** or **positively oriented**. Any basis that is not in the given orientation is said to be **negatively oriented**.
> * For the special case of a zero-dimensional vector space $V$, we define an orientation of $V$ to be simply a choice of one of the numbers $\pm 1$.
