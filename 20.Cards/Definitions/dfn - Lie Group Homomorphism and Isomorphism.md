> [!definition] Definition: 
> If $G$ and $H$ are Lie groups.
> * A **Lie group homomorphism from $G$ to $H$** is a smooth map $F: G \to H$ that is also a group homomorphism. 
> *  It is called a **Lie group isomorphism** if it is also a diffeomorphism, which implies that it has an inverse that is also a Lie group homomorphism. In this case we say that $G$ and $H$ are **isomorphic Lie groups**.
