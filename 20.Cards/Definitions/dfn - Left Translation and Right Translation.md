## Definition

> [!definition] Definition: 
> If $G$ is a Lie group, any element $g\in G$ defines maps $L_g, R_g: G\to G$, called **left translation** and **right translation**, respectively, by
> $$\begin{aligned} 
> L_g(h) = gh, \quad R_g(h) = hg.
> \end{aligned}$$

## Elementary Properties

> [!proposition] Proposition: 
> $L_{g}$ and $R_{g}$ are diffeomorphisms.

> [!proof] Proof: 
> Because $L_{g}$ can be expressed as the composition of smooth maps
>  $$ G\xrightarrow{\iota _{g}} G\times G\xrightarrow{m} G   $$, where $\iota _{g}\left(h\right)= \left(g,h\right)$ and $m$ is multiplication, it folows that $L_{g}$ is smooth. UIt is actually a diffeomorphism of $G$, beacuse $L_{g^{-1} }$ is a mooth inverse for it .
