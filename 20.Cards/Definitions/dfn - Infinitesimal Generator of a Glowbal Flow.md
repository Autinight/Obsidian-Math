> [!theorem] Theorem: 
> If $\theta: \mathbb{R} \times M \to M$ is a smooth global flow, for each $p\in M$ we define a tangent vector $V_p \in T_p M$ by
> $$V_p = \theta^{(p)\prime}(0).$$
> The assignment $p \mapsto V_p$ is a (rough) vector field on $M$, which is called the **infinitesimal generator of $\theta$**, for reasons we will explain below.
