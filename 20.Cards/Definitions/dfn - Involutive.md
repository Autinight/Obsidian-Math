> [!definition] Definition: 
> Suppose $D$ is a smooth distribution on $M$. We say that $D$ is **involutive** if given any pair of smooth local sections of $D$ (i.e., smooth vector fields $X, Y$ defined on an open subset of $M$ such that $X_p, Y_p \in D_p$ for each $p$), their Lie bracket is also a local section of $D$.
