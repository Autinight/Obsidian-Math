## Definition

> [!definition] Definition: 
> Let $B$ be a base in a root system $R$. We define the **Dynkin diagram** of $R$, denoted by $\Delta = \Delta \left(R\right)$ as follows.
> The vertices of $\Delta$ are labelled by the [[dfn - Simple Roots and Simple Reflections|Simple Roots]] of $B$. Between the vertices labelled by simple roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we draw $d _{\alpha \beta }$ lines, where 
>  $$ d _{\alpha \beta }:= \left< \alpha ,\beta  \right>\left< \beta ,\alpha  \right>\in \left\{ 0,1,2,3 \right\}. $$
> If $d _{\alpha \beta }> 1$, which happens whenever $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have different lengths and are not orthogonal, we draw an arrow pointing from the longer root to the shorter root.

> [!remark] Remark: 
> By [[thm - Weyl Group Acts Transitively on the family of bases]], the Dynkin diagram of $R$ is independent of the choice of base.
