> [!definition] Definition: 
> *  Given a rank-$k$ distribution $D \subseteq TM$, let us say that a smooth coordinate chart $(U, \varphi)$ on $M$ is **flat for $D$** if $\varphi(U)$ is a cube in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and at points of $U$, $D$ is spanned by the first $k$ coordinate vector fields $\partial/\partial x^1, \dots, \partial/\partial x^k$. In any such chart, each slice of the form $x^{k+1} = c^{k+1}, \dots, x^n = c^n$ for constants $c^{k+1}, \dots, c^n$ is an integral manifold of $D$.
> *   We say that a distribution $D \subseteq TM$ is **completely integrable** if there exists a flat chart for $D$ in a neighborhood of each point of $M$. 

> [!remark] Remark: 
> * Flart chart is the niceset possible **local** situation for integral properties.
> * We may consider the completely integrability  as an integrability equiped with the nicest local integral property.
> * Obviously, every completely integrable distribution is integrable and therefore involutive.
