## Statement

> [!definition] Definition:
> The covering projection $p : \overline{X} \longrightarrow X$ is called a **normal covering** if the subgroup $p_\#(\pi_1(\overline{X}, \bar{x}))$ is normal in $\pi_1(X, x)$.


## Characterization

> [!theorem] Theorem: 
> The covering projection $p: \overline{X}\to X$ is normal covering iff given a loop $\omega$ at $x$, all its lifts to $\overline{X}$ are either loops or none is .

> [!proof] Proof: 
> If $p$ is normal, since [[pps - Fiber and Conjugacy Class]], all the $p_{\sharp}\left(\pi_1\left(X, \bar{x}\right)\right)$ are the same, where $\bar{x}\in F^{-1} \left(x\right)$. $\omega$ lifts to a loop at $\bar{x}$, iff $\omega\in p_{\sharp}\left(\pi_1\left(X, \bar{x}\right)\right)$([[thm - Lifting and Fundemental Group]]), thus all its lifts are either loops or none is .
