## Definition

> [!definition] Definition: 
> For each root $\alpha \in R$, $s_{\alpha }$ atcs as an invertible linear map of $E$. We define the group of invertible linear transformations of $E$ generated by the reflections $s_{\alpha }$ for $\alpha \in R$, to be the **Weyl group of $\mathbb{R}$**, and is denoted by **$W$** or **$W\left(R\right)$**.

## Finiteness

> [!lemma] Lemma: 
> The Weyl group $W$ associated to to $R$ is finite.

> [!proofsketch] Sketch of Proof: 
> * 公理(R3) [[Root System#Statement]]确保了反射是$R$的置换,.
> * $R$生成 $E$, 故$R$的恒等变换一定是$E$的恒等变换, 从而Weyl群视作$R$的置换群的子群, 是一个有限群.
