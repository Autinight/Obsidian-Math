## Definition

> [!definition] Definition: 
> The connected components of $E- \bigcup _{\alpha }P_{\alpha }$ are called the (open) **Weyl chambers** of $E$.

## Properties

> [!proposition] Proposition: 
> Weyl chambers are in natural 1-1 correspondence with bases.
> We write $\mathfrak{C}\left(\Delta \right)= \mathfrak{C}\left(\gamma \right)$ if $\Delta = \Delta \left(\gamma \right)$, and call this the **fundamental Wey chamber relative to $\Delta$**.
