## Statement

> [!definition] Definition: 
> * A sequence of distribution functions is said to **converge weakly** to a limit $F$ (written $F_n \Rightarrow F$) if $F_n(y) \to F(y)$ for all $y$ that are continuity points of $F$. 
> * A sequence of random variables $X_n$ is said to **converge weakly** or **converge in distribution** to a limit $X_\infty$ (written $X_n \Rightarrow X_\infty$) if their distribution functions $F_n(x) = P(X_n \le x)$ converge weakly.
