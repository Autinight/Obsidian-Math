## Statement

> [!definition] Definition: 
> Suppose a function $f$ is defined on $I = [a, b]$. The **total variation** of $f$ from $a$ to $x$, $x \leq b$, is defined by $$V_f(a; x) = \sup \sum_{i=1}^k |f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})|,$$ where the supremum is taken over all finite sequences $a = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_k = x$. A function $f$ is said to be of **bounded variation** (abbreviated BV) on $[a, b]$ if $V_f(a; b) < \infty$. If there is no danger of confusion, we will sometimes write $V_f(x)$ in place of $V_f(a; x)$.
